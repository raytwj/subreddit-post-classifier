ethereum,statelessness  state expiry,  have long wanted   write   post about this but have been patiently waiting for some concrete progress this happened today with vitalik  update with   provisional roadmap with protoeips   state expiry and statelessness roadmap  hackmd ethereumorg  currently the single greatest bottleneck   scalability   state bloat you need       ssd   run   full node reliably with some futureproofing and some have complained that  already too much   the network   used the state will only keep growing the only recourse   manage state thus far has been   severely limit scalability there are two concepts that are being proposed right now   solve this longstanding challenge  weak statelessness   the weak statelessness scheme only block proposers and full nodes will need   hold full state all other nodes including attesting validators can run   stateless client and verify blocks without actually storing state how this works oversimplifying you don  need   hold the state but just need   succinct   the literal sense proof called   witness   verify state this concept has been around but the issue thus far was that even the witnesses were too large the technology   finally ready   enable very small witnesses verkle trees currently ethereum  state   stored   hexary trees   know the beacon chain has the concept   epochs where blocks are justified and finalized   per this protoeip ethereum will have   new time scale period one period will   approximately one year   enable statelessness   hardfork will freeze the prefork hexary tree period   while all new data appended   accessed postfork will live   the new verkle tree kicking off period   whenever stateless clients are ready post the transition   verkle trees all regular users will   able   verify statelessly   mentioned before block proposers will still need   hold the full state this will   controversial but the important thing here     have   culture   users verifying and that   accomplished   weak statelessness gas limits can now   increased and while block proposers will have   upgrade their systems regular users might actually see   decreased system requirement with stateless clients despite higher scalability   course strong statelessness where even blocks can   proposed statelessly will remain   future problem     solved  state expiry   lot   ethereum  state hasn  been accessed   years yet all nodes are burdened with this data forever what   you could only hold the relevant recently accessed data while archive again literally lapsed data proposals around state rent state expiry and regenesis have suggested similar schemes but now   have   concrete protoeip for the longest time state expiry and statelessness were considered competing solutions   the same problem but amazingly now they are both being implemented together each period state from two periods years ago   frozen and archived   state expiry full nodes and block proposers will only need   store state from two periods  the current and the previous users looking   verify transactions will continue   verify statelessly the state expiry hard fork happens   the beginning   period     roughly   year after moving   verkle trees and enabling weak stateleness here the prestatelessness period   hex tree will   replace with   verkle tree    expect from period   the period   state will expire and     overall both combined state management will   effectively   solved and   can start increasing gas limits without worrying about longterm state bloat however expect this increase     moderate around     suggested   vitalik   believe this       very conservative estimate particularly with ssds continuing   become more affordable now   have mainstream 400500 game consoles well when they  available shipping with extremely fast     nvme ssds   the time statelessness  state expiry ship   fully expect budget laptops   feature     and above ssds further clients like erigon are putting     lot   work   optimize this      optimistically expect    10x increase   scalability instead while still reducing system requirements compared   now though   course   course   ssds becomes more affordable over time   can scale linearly now that   have predictable state management users can revive expired data   paying gas for   what about expired state there can obviously   archive nodes which can continue   contain the full state this will almost certainly   very very expensive      need some sort   infrastructure for expired state   believe solana   exploring using arweave for similar state rent schemes though   wasn  able   find any details ipfs bittorrent filecoin and others are all options  rollups and sharding state management   crucial for rollups because they are designed around having immense state bloat because the entire rollup state can   reconstructed from   they can   even more innovative and flexible with how they approach this things like regenesis are easily done rollups can   the perfect way   battletest these new schemes being proposed    expect optimistic ethereum for example   transition   verkle trees and state expiry well before ethereum mainnet does with much shorter periods given   already has   archival mechanism       course rollups will benefit directly from whatever scalability upgrades state management brings       well statelessness  state expiry will directly multiply sharding execution   each shard will also feature these scalability improvements though given the scalability improvements statelessness  state expiry bring   the single execution chain and the scalability rollups  data sharding offer would   even need executable shards   the foreseeable future seems doubtful       wasn  able   find any concrete information   how the current proposals will directly affect data shards but    expect many   these concepts     adapted for     the future  concluding proof stake will solve sustainability rollups  data sharding will solve scalability state size management was the last remaining challenge and    being met head   with some real concrete proposals now one could argue that privacy and   innovations are   further pending challenge but    expect rollups   better better address these indeed    seeing this with aztec being privacyfocused while zksync    introduces llvm and starkware has built   quantumresistant starknet     course learnings from these rollups can   adopted       desired

ethereum,just buy and hold eth   using aave   uniswap   alchemix,    the only one who doesn  get the appeal   all   these financial crypto stuff    really don  understand why anyone wouldn  just keep investing   eth and hold   transferring eth and converting them   tokens   alchemix   uniswap   aave and start doing stakingpooling   earn   relatively tiny amount   interest rate   exchange face   lot more risks   losing their eth    the case   uniswap    you are pooling you are trading     eth toward another coin that   the longrun   not going       valuable   eth   you are losing money due   price divergence   exchange for getting fees but those fees are gonna   small   the long run compared   just holding 100   eth and see   appreciate    the case   aave you are giving   eth   exchange for aave  atoken while theoretically this atoken gives you interest rate the value   atoken could grow slower than eth   the longrun   have something else happen     point       not eth which still means you are losing out when compared   just straight   holding eth plus interest rate   pretty low nowadays for depositing eth   aave anyways trying any other crypto   too risky and there are still unknown risks and costs   just moving money around   aave    the case   alchemix  again    great that you get some upfront money but then you have   pay   back over time plus pay interests and you are asked   pay more than you get   the beginning     the long run you still lose money alchemix   basically   loan shark people love getting money upfront but   what cost      not looking   make 100     looking   10x   investment and   think the best way     this     just buy eth and hold all   these fancy financial instruments are full   traps and act more like   bank for the poor     casino   lottery machine for those who are addicted   gambling   the end the house always wins    think maybe   you work       hedge fund trading crypto you can build   algorithm   take advantage   loop holes but ordinary people should just stick with buy and hold

ethereum,  proposed scheme for encoding ethereum state into   verkle tree,link   one   the things that   want       the same time   moving the current ethereum state     verkle tree    cut witness sizes     move   from the current  layer trie inside   trie structure     singlelayer structure you may have seen diagrams   the ethereum state like this before      formatpng autowebp  c2bd8d1c96c15f24bfca6fbef65ab11b4134f469 the state consists     set   accounts where each account contains   header each header   turn contains   pointer     piece   code and   root   another whole accountspecific tree this structure has   few really annoying problems      complicated there    lot   extra code that needs     written   handle the treeinside tree mechanism   well   the special cases for accessing things   the account header that are not storage   noncebalancecode this complexity appears   many places database readswrites merkle proof construction merkle proof verification syncing caching      unbalanced there are individual subtrees that have   huge amount   data   them this   annoying for state sync protocols because you can  make any assumption that what looks like   small portion   the state   all objects starting with 0x7a5 will actually   small     doubles worstcase tree attack lengths     becomes even more complicated   figure out the interplay between state and mechanisms such   state expiry  anything that manipulates the state piece piece would need separate logic for accountlevel and storageslotlevel manipulations   propose   alternative which fits the entire ethereum state into   single keyvalue trie that   every position   the state   address storageslot address nonce address codechunkindex gets mapped     single  byte key which   where     stored

saves witness space for common use cases verifying many header fields   code chunks   adjacent storage slots note that accounts will   longer   under one subtree the way they are today different parts   the storage     account will     different locations   the state trie for the sake   illustration here  part   the code     proposal which shows how values inside addresses will get mapped   trie keys def gettreekeyaddress address treeindex int subindex int return  hashaddress  treeindextobytes  big   bytes   def gettreekeyforbalanceaddress address return gettreekeyaddress     def

gettreekeyaddress  248  storagekey  256 storagekey  256  notice   particular how values   the header get mapped   trie keys that share the first   bytes   they are part   the same bottomlevel commitment and adjacent storage slots and code too benefit from the same treatment  additionally storage slots    have the privilege   being part   the same bottomlevel commitment   the header   witness size for accessing these frequently used slots   really low gas costs see next section will   adjusted   take advantage   this the current proposal charges   flat 200 gas per slot for these first   slots  witness gas cost reform   important reform that needs   happen alongside this   gas cost reform finishing the work that was started   eip 2929   making gas costs closely map   witness data usage   all cases this allows     ensure tight witness size bounds for ethereum blocks even including worstcase attacks   the trie that require    computing power    looking       witnesses under more normal circumstances witness size will          necessary part   this   introducing gas costs for accessing code chunks see this protoeip  the current plan   200 gas per  byte chunk that protoeip goes further however and harmonizes gas costs more generally   that they align with this trie structure 1900 gas for   new branch proof and 200 gas for   new value   the same bottomlevel commitment some preliminary analysis   code chunk gas costs have shown that this may increase contract calling cost     however this new gas scheme will also introduce some important benefits for developers   notable benefit   that gas costs for accessing many adjacent storage slots   single persistent variables   solidity are typically mapped   storage slots        will drop from 2100 per storage slot   200 per storage slot after the first hence welldesigned contracts could easily get savings that make   for the increased cost   code access additionally the perchunk and persubtree costs mean that contracts that call   libraries will   longer   much less efficient than large contracts that keep all their code together   one piece

ethereum,ethereum and cardano are both   few years old eth has many projects building   its platform while cardano barely has any why   that,same for polkadot and    only   year old cardano does not seem   attract developers and projects why   you think this      heard   the haskell programming language   difficult   master   just very different than traditional programming languages   eth and dot gave   lot   funds away   projects building   their platforms while cardano focused   development and peer reviewed research implementation instead   cardano does not have smart contracts yet while eth and dot sort     cardano   incomplete   the point    not worth     build     yet    cardano doesn  sufficiently add any improvements over eth   other smart contract coins  this   what    heard    wondering   any   this   true and what you think about the lack   projects building   cardano

ethereum,  unedited uncensored thoughts about ethereum cardano tezos formal proofs and functional programming being   gimmick,warning this post     huge wall   unedited thoughts  when browsing another thread    this subreddit    noticed   comment about cardano from  theoryearly who wrote     dont think   sounds promising   all      all programmers   not give   single fuck about functional programming   formal verification    literally   gimmick   scam nonprogrammers with   ico   programmers aren  attracted   cardano only fucking retarded investors who think functional programming and formal verification   some magic bullet first   all cardano     mess that does not represent how   functional blockchain should   made but    talk about this subject later for now    like   talk about the       gimmick part rather than getting offended and discard  theoryearly   someone who just doesn  get   like most   elitists would probably   this inspires     really understand where this perception comes from evaluate its merits and wonder what could   done   change   this isn  just   isolated case when   was developing formality    felt that impression coming from many   you and   know many   you feel that way rightfully           job   understand this feeling its roots and figure out how   change       true that functional programming and formal verification has certain fame   being overhyped tools that   the end provide little     practical benefit   the same time those who   get   ultimately fall   love and almost universally come   the conclusion that     objectively profoundly superior   the alternatives isn  that weird why there   such   huge disconnect between people who get   think     the best thing ever and everyone else who just watches from the outside and judges       useless gimmick   think both sides have   fair judgement the thing   when you     personal level learn about   you instantly realize how good         obvious for you because all the tools   directly provides you objectively make you   better programmer today you get access   abstractions like functors monads folds composition   nextgen typesystem learning   use these things properly makes you   much better that you wonder how you could ever lived   long without those things and then you start preaching about how amazing     and write about burritos and ultimately proceed   build nothing   real value   that happens sooo often but why         objectively better where are all the cool things built with     have   simple answer   that paradox but   might make some people really upset with   haskell isn    practical language and that  all see there are some practical   languages like scala and clojure but these are practical exactly because   all the non  concepts mixed   they are hybrid multiparadigm languages   that doesn  count     solid argument   favor     when   comes   fully embracing   there   only one mature language   the market haskell and that language isn  practical simple   that   hope that doesn  make  haskell upset with   but   much     love     isn    haskell has possibly the worst package manager   the world     not just bad     terrible     can  install more than   libs without breaking the world terrible       bad the community had   create   second package manager that maintains   curated list   packages that work   conjunction which kinda works but   requires   ton   work   doesn  scale and   still breaks   you need   install anything outside   that curated list   its error messages are sometimes great sometimes completely cryptic problem     takes just one cryptic messages   waste hours   your time even worse   the end often   isn  even your fault which takes         messy soup   package extensions that   required   make   for the lack   dependent types sooner   later something you need     will not work just because haskell can  understand   and then you  need   add extensions like rankntypes gadts flexibleinstances scopedtypevariables and eventually you  coding     frankenstein dialect with error messages that not even the author understands   too many obscure academic words that exist for historical reasons     good reason this only further isolates the community     bubble     word requires explaining   isn    good word   programmer shouldn  learn   whole new vocabulary   just get started things like why isn  functor called mappeable   the idiomatic syntax isn  very practical for example   fold   beautiful when the body   short but when     large   requires you   indent your code   bizarre ways see    comment for   example the acclaimed pointfree style often leads   unreadable oneliners that   1000 things the equational notation for function declaration becomes redundant once you have many arguments and   doesn  scale vertically monads are   genius profound way   handle effects once you spend   semester learning about them and getting overwhelmed   the awful   plain wrong tutorials patternmatching records with many fields requires you   rename all fields every single time extracting big   deep fields   extremely verbose almost forcing you   deal with lenses which then require another semester   courses      cryptic symbols and once you     have fun with your 10x performance penalty and then you miss the times when you could just write foobar        finally and perhaps mostly its failure   compete   the frontend userfacing space there   still   viable   compiler   satisfactory way   make iosandroid apps   windowsosxlinux releases    short what    saying   that haskell     very unpractical language out   the box and that       major contributor   this perception that       gimmick and don  get   wrong    not hating   haskell     still one     favorite languages and   can   extremely powerful for   individual   isolate team with enough time but   truly don  think     going   say replace typescript anytime soon   just doesn  scale communitywise and what   the point   being   godlike programmer     language that few use only   get beat       freshman who just installed   npm package that does what   wanted but       concept that    different matter   has   lot   potential and   don  think anybody will   able   judge   until they truly get     this sparks the question what would happen     had   catual hardcore functional language with all the power   haskell but none   its practical problems    one that would     easy   learn   typescript one that would strip away all the academic jargon one with amazing error messages one with   easy obvious ways   anything you     conventional languages effects field updates loops one that like typescript was ready   scale into   massive ecosystem   realworld applications yet one that under the hoods was grounded   the solid foundations   type theory with dependent types formal proofs and all that powerful stuff waiting for you when  and    you  ready for       had such   language what would happen would the common developer still dismiss       weird thing   weird people   would they suddenly realize the immense power that   has and fall   love   honestly deeply strongly think the later would happen     right     wrong well for one   could almost see that happening   few years ago powered   another language elm   did just some   the things   sad and the result was clear     quickly grew     one   the most used functional languages but   had   big issue   simplified things   much   ended   shallow once you learned enough and started needing the additional power   wasn  there the

substance that promises   change the world yet can  deliver smartcontracts after half   decade   existence   think cardano     big disservice for the   community when   comes   formally verified smartcontracts kindethereum   all   ever need and      not saying formal proofs are   silver bullet for security but     think   will massively improve the issue and   promise eventually you  get   but how for some time   thought        matter   compiling kind   the evm that would allow you   write normal kind programs and run them inside ethereum   don  think that     great idea anymore the gas overhead   compiling lambdas   little     make them    still superior         network where every opcode costs   fortune people would just write     cheaper less safe language and   reality smartcontracts are often simple and don  require all the features you have   kind    for now the plan     just create   smartcontract dsl   kind with   reasonable syntax sugar that will allow people   write ethereum smartcontracts embedded     they  then   able   easily deploy monitor and prove things about these contracts simple easy and effective sure this   something that can   done   agda idris coq too and perhaps that   why    avoided this solution for   while but honestly that   the way     and these are not practical languages either   don  think they  ever have massive ecosystems   doing     kind will enable formally verified smartcontracts for the masses which   something new now please tell   once kind   popular has   great ecosystem and people can easily write deploy and verify ethereum smartcontracts     then what   even the point   cardano anymore   what technical sense   even needs   exist   doesn  scale better than ethereum the built  forking stuff     actual gimmick and   isn  safer   more functional   any way     honestly can  find   reason   anyone has   great answer   that question let   know because    been waiting for years and there   none     clear   don  want   sound like   hater    not lying when   say   love when    proven wrong because   can cut losses and stop wasting   time     wrong idea just   kind please but for now   can  look   cardano and not think what   the point   rather why people are   hyped about something that       head objectively inferior   what    building     that out   touch    just trying   understand what cardano does the best arguments    found   far are that   haskell   safer than solidity fair but kind   much safer than haskell     large margin   there anyone who disagrees with that   are you telling   that cardano built   entire network with the whole premise   being   safer more functional alternative   ethereum only     obsolete   soon     actual proof language adds support   ethereum smartcontracts   are they betting that   proof language like kind will never   popular enough     viable   that people will never realize haskell doesn  even have formal proofs    our virtualmachine language   easier   reason about fair but   dsl   kind that compiles   the evm can also   made very easy   reason about there     need   create   whole network around that now     clear   still think compiling kind   its own inetbased functional virtual machine     fucking amazing idea that would justify building its own separate blockchain because the cost model     beautifully great but that    lot   work and not what cardano   proposing      fair   could   really misunderstanding something since cardano smartcontracts aren  even written   haskell and     still not clear     what   the actual language used for       plutus     marlowe what   the execution environment that every full node runs       stackmachine are there lambdas what are the opcodes where   the cost table   there even one how much   betareduction costs how   they measure that perhaps    too dumb   get   but   mean     can  get   how   they expect everyone will   has been years and   still don  get cardano and   swear    not lazy    tried for   comparison   took       minutes   open ethereum  yellow paper and immediately get its point anyway these are    edited thoughts about all these things for whoever this may interest about kind soon      back with   bunch   cool things   show   just hope people give   some space   show these things   cardano deserves   54b network   deserve some attention       sad   see crap getting   much attention while people building real stuff gets ignored but fair enough the market decides what   wants for now    keep building see you eventually
ethereum,  unedited uncensored thoughts about ethereum cardano tezos formal proofs and functional programming being   gimmick,warning this post     unedited stream   thoughts  when browsing another thread    this subreddit    found   post about cardano from  theoryearly who wrote     dont think   sounds promising   all      all programmers   not give   single fuck about functional programming   formal verification    literally   gimmick   scam nonprogrammers with   ico   programmers aren  attracted   cardano only fucking retarded investors who think functional programming and formal verification   some magic bullet first   all cardano     mess that does not represent how   functional blockchain should   made but    talk about this subject later for now    like   talk about the       gimmick part rather than getting offended and discard  theoryearly   someone who just doesn  get   like most   elitists would probably   this inspires     really understand where this perception comes from evaluate its merits and wonder what could   done   change   this isn  just   isolated case when   was developing formality    felt that impression coming from many   you and   know many   you feel that way rightfully           job   understand this feeling its roots and figure out how   change       true that functional programming and formal verification has certain fame   being overhyped tools that   the end provide little     practical benefit   the same time those who   get   ultimately fall   love and almost universally come   the conclusion that     objectively profoundly superior   the alternatives isn  that weird why there   such   huge disconnect between people who get   think     the best thing ever and everyone else who just watches from the outside and judges       useless gimmick   think both sides have   fair judgement the thing   when you     personal level learn about   you instantly realize how good         obvious for you because all the tools   directly provides you objectively make you   better programmer today you get access   abstractions like functors monads folds composition   nextgen typesystem learning   use these things properly makes you   much better that you wonder how you could ever lived   long without those things and then you start preaching about how amazing     and write about burritos and ultimately proceed   build nothing   real value   that happens sooo often but why         objectively better where are all the cool things built with     have   simple answer   that paradox but   might make some people really upset with   haskell isn    practical language and that  all see there are some practical   languages like scala and clojure but these are practical exactly because   all the non  concepts mixed   they are hybrid multiparadigm languages   that doesn  count     solid argument   favor     when   comes   fully embracing   there   only one mature language   the market haskell and that language isn  practical simple   that   hope that doesn  make  haskell upset with   but   much     love     isn    haskell has possibly the worst package manager   the world     not just bad     terrible     can  install more than   libs without breaking the world terrible       bad the community had   create   second package manager that maintains   curated list   packages that work   conjunction which kinda works but   requires   ton   work   doesn  scale and   still breaks   you need   install anything outside   that curated list   its error messages are sometimes great sometimes completely cryptic problem     takes just one cryptic messages   waste hours   your time even worse   the end often   isn  even your fault which takes         messy soup   package extensions that   required   make   for the lack   dependent types sooner   later something you need     will not work just because haskell can  understand   and then you  need   add extensions like rankntypes gadts flexibleinstances scopedtypevariables and eventually you  coding     frankenstein dialect with error messages that not even the author understands   too many obscure academic words that exist for historical reasons     good reason this only further isolates the community     bubble     word requires explaining   isn    good word   programmer shouldn  learn   whole new vocabulary   just get started things like why isn  functor called mappeable   the idiomatic syntax isn  very practical for example   fold   beautiful when the body   short but when     large   requires you   indent your code   bizarre ways see    comment for   example the acclaimed pointfree style often leads   unreadable oneliners that   1000 things the equational notation for function declaration becomes redundant once you have many arguments and   doesn  scale vertically monads are   genius profound way   handle effects once you spend   semester learning about them and getting overwhelmed   the awful   plain wrong tutorials patternmatching records with many fields requires you   rename all fields every single time extracting big   deep fields   extremely verbose almost forcing you   deal with lenses which then require another semester   courses      cryptic symbols and once you     have fun with your 10x performance penalty and then you miss the times when you could just write foobar        finally and perhaps mostly its failure   compete   the frontend userfacing space there   still   viable   compiler   satisfactory way   make iosandroid apps   windowsosxlinux releases    short what    saying   that haskell     very unpractical language out   the box and that       major contributor   this perception that       gimmick and don  get   wrong    not hating   haskell     still one     favorite languages and   can   extremely powerful for   individual   isolate team with enough time but   truly don  think     going   say replace typescript anytime soon   just doesn  scale communitywise and what   the point   being   godlike programmer     language that few use only   get beat       freshman who just installed   npm package that does what   wanted but       concept that    different matter   has   lot   potential and   don  think anybody will   able   judge   until they truly get     this sparks the question what would happen     had   catual hardcore functional language with all the power   haskell but none   its practical problems    one that would     easy   learn   typescript one that would strip away all the academic jargon one with amazing error messages one with   easy obvious ways   anything you     conventional languages effects field updates loops one that like typescript was ready   scale into   massive ecosystem   realworld applications yet one that under the hoods was grounded   the solid foundations   type theory with dependent types formal proofs and all that powerful stuff waiting for you when  and    you  ready for       had such   language what would happen would the common developer still dismiss       weird thing   weird people   would they suddenly realize the immense power that   has and fall   love   honestly deeply strongly think the later would happen     right     wrong well for one   could almost see that happening   few years ago powered   another language elm   did just some   the things   sad and the result was clear     quickly grew     one   the most used functional languages but   had   big issue   simplified things   much   ended   shallow once you learned enough and started needing the additional power   wasn  there the language was too limited     certain things   the hype eventually died off but   you really need   overly simplify the core language   order   make   simple     don  think   you can just   careful   get these things out   the way   the common developer and that can   accomplished   serving the common developer   familiar syntax that   just enough for him   thrive the advanced stuff can still

ethereum,nature and history   money property rights fraud and the potential   crypto the context,dear all   might     good idea   introduce some basic concepts   the community – especially nowadays   most people are focused   prices and shortterm gains even though this might have been written down multiple times   believe that     valuable   bring   together     unique piece   information   decided   post this text   multiple subreddits   reach more people   lot   people   the subreddit here   not understand basic but important concepts   money and its history –   state   affairs that     motivated   help change after reading this text   shall   clear why   belongs   these subreddits   the topic covered     philosophical and economical nature crypto   way more than just asking the question ‘when moon’  what   money over time gold and silver were used   money money   defined     means   exchange storage   value and   unit   calculate prices with but how did   come that across continents   many different cultures used these precious metals   money consider the natural situation where the economy   not well developed   you want   exchange something you need   use barter which   inefficient and time consuming the detection     good usable   money   crucial   benefit society     allows participants   use their most sacred resource – their lifetime –   pursue other things with the time saved from barter exchange but how does   good become money there   one common evolution that can   observed and logically explained – ludwig edler von mises termed   the ‘regression theory   money’   his habilitation ‘theorie des geldes und der umlaufmittel’   english ‘the theory   money and credit’ from 1912 this theorem states that money has value     now because   had value yesterday put into context nowadays one might say that this   the network effect but   you ‘regress’ this back   time there has       starting point the first time   good becomes money   the transition     valuable product into   mean   exchange and this mean should   commonly accepted across market participants gold and silver were valued   jewellery   many people     barter economy would   fine with accepting this the transition   this value into   mean   exchange leads     network effect were the good gets   monetary value   well     called tauschwert this   remarkable   people who don’  valued jewellery   all would start accepting this because   its tauschwert the same could   observed after world war     germany were american cigarettes became   mean   exchange   the destroyed german economy even nonsmokers accepted   after   had gotten   tauschwert besides there are exotic examples   monetary goods such   the  called ‘rai stones’   micronesia that were small   very large round stones with   circle hole   the middle and not easily transportable but used   money this     nice example that   common belief can result   the emergence   money but does the micronesia example contradict mises’ theorem not necessarily   value   subjective and   very strong also religious belief might   well provide value   itself nevertheless the more ‘classic’ transition     valuable product resulting   money was clearly the norm but this   not enough money should also   hard   fake   should ideally   dividable   smaller units and   should definitely   long lasting all these reasons spoke for precious metals like gold and silver     nutshell the fact that they are hard   fake and that their supply   not increasing ambiguously make them ideal money why     solid and slow increasing supply important   you aim   storing value   time this characteristic follows from basic economic thinking   supplydemand the demand   quite stable and will   increasing over time   societies and economies get more efficient trust   the fact that the gold   silver supply will not just double   two years make   ideal   store value over time     people can’    trusted easily precious metals scarcity and their difficulty   counterfeit made them ideal for people   trade without trusting some specific entity unfortunately there was one problem states empires could monopolize the minting and this   what usually happened the nominal value     coin could   the same but the amount   precious metal inside could   reduced   order   mint more coins the first quantitative easing was born with these methods empires could finance their expensive wars the roman empire wars are   perfect example   this process    things went   gold smiths the first banks     speak started   accept gold promised   deposit     exchange for   paper certificate verifying the amount   gold whoever claimed that certificate   the protobank was able   get the physical gold this   where the ‘trustlayer’ comes   gold   itself   trustless one ounce   gold   one ounce   gold period but   human technology evolved over time making life more comfortable and easier the need for convenient means   exchange representing money the gold   deposits like paper became clear but you might guess the potential misuse   such   system   issuing more certificates than what could   backed   gold some protobanks discovered the cantillon effect  seigniorage whoever would make use   its newly created certificates first could accumulate wealth while subsequent users would   faced with   decrease   the monetary value   their certificates indeed after the new certificates find their way through the economy and aren’  hoarded somewhere prices tend         phenomenon commonly referred     ‘inflation’ without going too much into detail this process   not proportional   the amount   newly created certificates but generally   the long term   effect   prices will occur one could interpret this wealth transfer under the lens   the fundamental laws   thermodynamics first and second law which states   very simplistic terms that ‘nothing   for free’   perpetuum mobile   possible the very same scientific truth applied   the economy nothing   for free someone always has   pay for     speak   out clearly this process   fraud and     not compatible with property rights   breaking the promise   gold depositing the bad actor clearly violates the underlying contract most people would not voluntarily accept   ambiguously inflating certificate scheme also   dilutes the purchasing power   old certificate holders     freemarket system these bad actors should get punished and   treated   criminals   the judicial system   place but states empires began   monopolize and  regulate the system and this   where the real drama begins   states empires are monopolies   force with limited control mechanisms   how this force was and   used     clear that this institution has   interest   extracting purchasing power from the peasants also called ‘taxpayer’ nowadays across history war financing was the main incentive   expand the power even further nowadays     still war financing but also social welfare programmes   the former also require large amounts   money just check the government spending   the usa and you will   surprised   the fact that way more   spent   social programmes than   military even though the defence budget   the usa   more than insane free markets and capitalism are incompatible with fiat money    already stated the dilution   purchasing power   fraud and incompatible with property rights   course you might   free   found   bank that   issuing more certificates than gold deposits and tell your customers about this procedure from the very beginning orally and also via contracts however with other actors competing for this market this   not likely       sustainable business model why should anyone put his   her hardearned money into such   bank this   why   today’  world     certainly not live   free markets     lot   people think   have elements   free markets for sure certainly this   true and certainly comes   various flavours take australia for example and compare     north korea but currently all states   the world have   fiatmoney regime money   itself could   classified     own type   good neither consumption nor production good one might conclude that   constitutes   class   its own   class   good that     important that   represents one side     trade for almost all trades     economy free markets and capitalism require property rights   this   the very definition       the means   production land labour properties machinery and     are private you have capitalism period even the degree   ‘private property’   controversial   the government owns large amounts   land the government regulates   lot   even   you are   private owner   paper   state can regulate   much that       facto also   owner   your property simply put this   the model   fascism instead   ‘collectivizing the means   production’ the government can ‘collectivize the individual’ your labour   taxed   the government and depending   where you live   quite   substantial amount and additionally   lot   people are paid directly   the government local   federal because they work   public officials and     but most importantly money       today   issued   central banks with   backing whatsoever therefore   central bank perverts the concept   free markets and capitalism even     central bank   partly ‘private’   the swiss national bank you can actually buy stocks from this central bank central banks are   creation   law and not   free markets why the   gold standard was   fraud scheme what     gold standard     strict and correct term   means that gold   money and every paper certificate using   means   exchange   100 backed     with this perspective the usa actually gave     with the founding   the first bank   america   1791 this central bank lasted until 1811 and was able   issue debt certificates     higher amount than what could   backed   gold the founding   the second bank   america   1816 was again against the principle     gold standard   better bimetallic standard   written   the constitution this institution lasted until 1836   the way andrew jackson president   the united states fought against the second bank   america and vetoed its charter   1833   1913 with the creation   the federal reserve bank   the federal reserve act the concept     national central bank became permanent compared   the former ones which only had licenses granted   congress officially the usa still had   gold standard but what   the motive behind   central bank under such   standard correct undermining     will come back   this point with the history   the federal reserve and the monetary supply during the 1920s   1933 the fraud got its first large scale mark with the decision   franklin delano roosevelt  executive order 6102 which came into effect the same year the nazis gained power   germany with this executive order   was forbidden for   citizens   own more than 100 usd   gold coin gold bullion and gold certificates within the continental united states one ounce   gold was the equivalent     usd this means that the citizens had   bring the exceeding gold   the federal reserve system there they got   usd   paper certificates for one ounce   gold this was   act   fraud and theft because the federal reserve   course had the ability   increase the debt amount now     could before diluting paper certificate holders the final act against the gold standard and its ultimate murder happened   august 15th 1971   richard nixon stating ‘  have directed secretary connally   suspend temporarily the convertibility   the dollar into gold   other reserve assets except   amounts and conditions determined       the interest   monetary stability and   the best interests   the united states’ source     took two world wars   get totally rid     goldstandard because   von mises’ regression theorem people continued accepting fiat money most   them did not even notice the difference after   president richard milhous nixon ‘temporarily’ stopped the exchange   dollars   gold   august 15th 1971 until now this   still   effect president nixon probably understood the word ‘temporarily’   cosmic orders   magnitude friedrich august von hayek and the ‘denationalisation   money’ von mises’ student friedrich august von hayek the real opponent   john maynard keynes and not milton friedman   commonly thought proposed the ‘denationalisation   money’ published   1976 this     truly important work and   was published during the stagflation times   the usa high price inflation rates low economy growth and higher unemployment hayek understood one basic fact about gold standards even though gold   great   itself the trustlayer with the government   flawed   design   proposed   free market for money   take away the power from the government   you want   know what kind   suffering has been imposed upon millions   people via fiat money first wars the logic   relatively simple you can’  finance large scale wars for   long time without fiat money actually the european nations abandoned the gold standard right   the outbreak   world war   world war   was also financed   fiat money second fiat money has been   instrument   steal people’  purchasing power with inflation   its most extreme version hyperinflation the purchasing power has even been reduced   null inflating   the money supply has caused booms and busts mises’ and hayek’  works   this topic   recommendable     also affects real interest rates which then affect human behaviour and     why   human behaviour affected well   interest rates are lower than     free market based   sound money shortterm borrowing becomes relatively easier and consumption   rewarded higher than longterm saving and wealth creation also companies might start using cheaper debt   finance themselves which changes their capital structure economic ventures become ‘worth  ’ with lower credit cost compared   the free market case furthermore states also take more debt thus     system with artificially low interest rates monetary funds resources and human labour get allocated     different way usually less efficient way than   would       sound money system the day when central banks have   raise interest rates   avoid hyperinflation the party ends the debt costs increase and refinancing becomes more expensive without such   monetary system the subprime mortgage crisis that lead   the financial crisis   20072009 would have never been possible these large risks wouldn’  have been taken     many and actually without huge additional money from the central banks and the business banks   would simply not   possible   drive   speculative frenzy   such epic proportions ruining   whole economy there   more   this but this goes far beyond   the scope     reddit post the business banks’ contribution   the increase   money supply happens through the fractional reserve banking regime what   fractional reserve banking you might ask   means that business bank can lend more money than   has   deposits which   decided   the central bank for example   you have your deposits     bank you officially lend this money   the bank which   turn lends     others but   doing   the business bank creates new virtual money   the bank must not hold 100  fiat reserves for all the claims that   why bankruns ruin banks   they   not have enough funds   cover all claims   large amounts   customers want cash maybe this makes you understand why central banks and governments are interested   introducing their own digital currencies   real dystopic nightmare       now clear that   free market for money would lead   more peace more stable economies with lower but steadier and more sustainable economic growth and this   why private banking with solid money like gold and   silver   better than the current status quo hayek wanted government completely out   this and that   for good reasons   regard   history and human nature   already mentioned even during the gold standard times   the usa   was possible   issue more paper certificates than gold the federal reserve actually did this during the roaring twenties contributing   the frenzy during these times which lead     catastrophe murray newton rothbard highlights this process   his work ‘america’  great depression’ from 1963 rothbard was   student   ludwig edler von mises and wrote besides economics also about financial history with focus   the usa   teaches   that the federal reserve total dollar claims   june 1921 were    billion usd with   total gold reserve      billion usd then   june 1929 the claimed dollar amount rose      billion usd      increase while the gold reserves rose only      billion usd   increase      table     page   can freely   accessed via   original source   banking and monetary statistics washington    federal reserve system 1943   544–  409 and 346–  but there still     problem even with   free market monetary system with   solid gold currency the trustlayer   still existent   least     not monopolized with the central bank and   cartel   business banks but market participants still have   trust the depositing institution which usually     bank   used       bank   gold has been completely demonetized  the invention   bitcoin and cryptocurrencies this   where crypto comes     apologize for this long history travel but     important   understand cryptocurrencies’ significance with the invention   bitcoin   was  for the first time   human history  possible   mimic gold and remove the trustlayer this   not   understatement let this sink     you understand the motivation for sound money and the incompatibility   fiat money with property rights its pivotal role   free markets and peace then   becomes clear that bitcoin   revolutionary but you may wonder how     possible that even people supporting sound money peter schiff being   prominent example disagree with the concept   cryptocurrencies and bitcoin there might   multiple reasons   this but one common argument   that   has   ‘inherent’ value however   applying von mises’ regression theorem one can definitely conclude why bitcoin has value first   went from barter   primitive money until many cultures and societies discovered gold and silver which were widely used throughout history then governments introduced   purely fiat system what gave fiat its value   was not the government just stating ‘here accept   now’ but   longlasting connection   gold even though not perfect but still the collective used dollar certificates and other certificates   other countries for generations   took two world wars   get   the current fiat regime the change was quiet and did not really appear   people’  daily life until price inflation hit thus the ‘regression’ went from gold   gold certificates   fiat with fiat being flawed   design bitcoin was proposed   counter the problems that come with the trustlayer this should certainly create   value for buyers especially   countries where you see the purchasing power being molten the historical perspective helps   understand why for bitcoin and   other cryptocurrencies     successful   strong network effect     prerequisite then the ‘regression’ pattern moves towards cryptocurrencies this   commonly  named adoption which cryptocurrency   cryptocurrencies will succeed will     bitcoin ethereum another crypto   mix   cryptos who knows   certainly don’  this decision has not been made   the market participants yet     are still   the early days   von mises’ regression theorem tells   that the transition from   valuable good     solid ground belief from the very beginning already happened and then regressed through time let’  note now that cryptocurrencies are also very powerful because governments will not   able   stop   control them     impossible   control every single machine connected   the internet even though   have nation states   least   don’  have   world state with   world government   one nation state decides   ban this technology    ban that   already hard   enforce   itself  there will   incentives for other nation states     even friendlier   coordinated worldwide nation state attempt   destroy cryptocurrencies   practically impossible and even   people will probably rise     they understand that something has     wrong this gives   hope     sad   see how governments and big corporations   bed with governments control people more and more and how the financial system gets sicker and sicker well   least     not have large scale totalitarianism     the 20th century but   witness the developments   more controls more economic interventions more money destruction through supply increase and this might lead     more totalitarian states but crypto   here   stay and evolve and     powerful     powerful because       means   disempowering nation states and the fiat money system without fiat money     impossible   sustain and finance large states spending huge amounts   money     way where the people making decisions did not earn the money   themselves     especially impossible   finance large scale wars   property that should   itself defeat the fiat money regime the fiat regime   the core   statism and totalitarianism  without its core element   can’  survive   course disinformation     crucial part   this but     not the core   statism and totalitarianism without fiat money but with disinformation these political forces cannot achieve much this   important   point understand   modern largescale wars and welfare states are impossible   finance with solid money this   why you can’  logically promote bitcoin   another serious crypto while being   collectivist either   socialist   fascist these ideologies are highly flawed     practical and ethical sense the argumentation about this statement more from the practical side has been done   ludwig edler von mises himself   his masterpiece ‘sozialismus eine ökonomische und soziologische analyse’ english ‘socialism   economic and sociological analysis’ from 1922 one   his main points   that under collectivized economies the central planners can’  calculate   prices   there     pricing mechanism telling participants what   worth pursue and what isn’  indeed with means   production that are not private   makes rational decisions about pricing impossible because these very same means   productions have   price friedrich august von hayek wrote   lot about the impossibility   collective economies focusing   the information problem and the inherent decentralized dynamics   the market mechanism but there are even more arguments against   here     simple one centralization   power   order   fulfill collective economies         local level with communities       large level across nation states will always corrupt people and notably more     the latter case   human nature         humans want the outputs without putting   the work and the energy there would     problem with socialistic communistic   fascist communities   they respected property rights   others but they don’    definition this   the moral difference between collectivism and individualism under   individualistic property rights centered order you can try whatever you want unless you don’  violate the property rights   others   this setup would you want   start   collectivist paradise   yourself and find people who want   voluntarily join you you are free     this ironically starting   business and   using sound money under   collectivist order would possibly result   penalties and   your death   the worst case interesting fact even when done voluntarily collectivist models fail this can   exemplified with the new harmony project   indiana usa during the 19th century   even the kibbutzim   israel many   which failed and   the remaining ones the large majority threw their hardcore collectivist ideals away     also interesting that internet devices and smart phones found their way   kibbutzim nowadays   should not   explained that under   total collectivized global economic regime hard work and innovation leading   our daily life’  devices wouldn’    possible just   the nature   human incentives and behaviour smart contracts and beyond even though bitcoin started   being   ‘peer peer electronic cashsystem’ and now seems   find its role     store   value with   lot   speculative elements       still early the idea   smart contracts provides even more power   decentralization   allowing   participate   businesses and trades without the trustlayer this   achievable   decentralizedfinance   nonfungibletokens which could become   standard for property exchange they could one day register governance via   hardencoded trustless protocol     blockchain   bond and stock exchanges that work with lower costs and higher efficiency without intermediaries way more applications could probably   enabled     such   decentralized trustensuring protocol all   this   unstoppable and will transform the world for the better       happy and proud that   all started with bitcoin with all its ups and downs and insane stories the sector keeps evolving attracting more and more visionaries and great minds contributing their part   this field furthermore the impact   these technologies   governance can   truly disruptive allowing more transparency   public finances   prevent corruption when dealing with public money     city province   even nation state there are many issues yet     solved from   technical and also architecture point   view surely     useful   have privacy   the sense that nobody can track where the tax money   coming from but   soon         the public side ready     spent   immutable blockchain could   quite helpful here the decentralisation   cryptos might even lead   political decentralisation solving problems   the local level where they arose   the first place who knows where this journey will bring   before finishing   shall   mentioned that the large banking sector needs the government and vice versa simplistic thinking might lead some   the conclusion that one single governmental bank and the abolition   interest rates will solve all problems but   you made   until here you probably understand why this   utopist and flawed governments are dangerous and   long   centralization   power exists special interests especially from the banking side will always lobby and gain privileges period with sound money the very core enabling large powerful states   removed besides with the use   smart contracts for governance there will hopefully   some additional pressure towards political decentralization always remember special interests will always try   collude governments and the more centralization the easier   gets       surprise that ancient greece with its decentralized nature with hundreds   small city states flourished   much compared   other areas   the world which marked the beginning     historic journey until   got modern civilization which was born and carried out   europe also   doesn’  come   any surprise that many small city states nowadays allow their citizens high levels   wealth without access   natural resources even the decentralized nature   switzerland advocated   many especially   citizens from the surrounding european union with its centralistic tendencies   combining the current best political system   the world and the most advanced social and economic freedom enabled   strong property rights doesn’  come   any surprise   the way the canton   zug where you can find the  called ‘crypto valley’   also located   switzerland conclusion cryptocurrencies are here   stay they will transform this world hayek’  dream will come true   there are   means   which governments can stop this evolution     convinced that hayek would   deeply happy about the evolution   this field the failure   fiat will   the victory   crypto even though gold and silver are great for monetary purposes especially when thinking about   intelligent alien   our galaxy that would probably rather accept gold than   cryptocurrency     human nature and thus the trustlayer that make   monetary system prone   corruption legal action and intervention   the government possible this messes   things even more than single bad actors   the market   the long run this   why gold and silver being valued not only for jewellery but also electronics and industry nowadays will probably always   valuable and   good hedge against price inflation   the long term their physical properties noteworthy that silver   the element with the highest electrical and heat conductivity which make   unique give them their own strengths and powers   believe that     too early   say which cryptocurrency   cryptocurrencies will make   let   see maximalism     singleminded attitude     fast evolving and relatively new field only time will tell what will succeed and what won’  but   can assure you one thing the idea   decentralized cryptocurrencies will succeed and make this world   better place hayek’  idea   more powerful than ever before and     gaining power and popularity the failure   fiat will   the victory   crypto

ethereum,questions about erc,hello   have been actively studying the ethereum blockchain for   while and   keep getting ahead   myself with all the directions people can take   see   exhaustive list   github with all the known major token standards there seems     like   differents kinds but   matter where   search there are   few things   can  seem   find   wonder   someone can clear   few things   for     maybe explain     where   understanding   incorrect   would also love some pointers   places   learn more about ethereum   places   learn about blockchain technology   general thank you     understand that these standards were made   simplify the process     token being accepted onto   exchange   that   can   swapped with other tokens can you make   token with   contract that isn  based   one   these standards       how hard would       get such   token     exchange   can  imagine   exchange would charge   much   all they had     was code   little bit   accept your token right     hear that smart contracts once made cannot   changed but   see things like erc1067 upgradeable   multidimensional tokens that seem   have the ability   add more functionality for your token even after you deploy

ethereum,what  the incentive for anyone   maintain   archive node   eth,  there   possibility that   might some day lose the history   ethreuem     the global state   some historic blocks like most validators full nodes just store the current global state  not the historic ones what incentive would anyone have   save terabytes   data containing the entire ethereum history more importantly what use would this have  also why don  people upload the entire history archive   ethereum   public repositories like zenodoarchiveorg instead   waiting for hours for     sync from other nodes wouldn  this   more efficient
ethereum,what price are you buying eth not advice just   community poll,  really   think ethereum has the platform   support the new crypto world   going   ramp     investment appropriately  ’  just curious   see where people have targeted their buys    have notoriously missed the bounce because   set   eyes     bottom that was juuuuuust too low     set   buys   even numbers and   bounces right above there

ethereum,what   the best argument for switching from pow   pos,     been buying eth for   few months now and   really   like the technology      however very concerned about the idea   switching   proof   stake    have done some research but     now haven  seen any good reasoning   all other than    good for the environment  clearly pos would consume less electricity but that   totally irrelevant   the reason one would invest   eth  people want   dependable secure reliable system   protect their investment saving energy     excuse   make the system objectively less secure doesn  make any sense      the entire purpose   the bitcoin pow system   that miners are investing   energy and converting that energy directly into bitcoin  the electricity used   mine bitcoin   actually creating bitcoin and storing energy   the coin itself  time   money and money   store   energy  work   the end       not here   shit   eth clearly         holder myself    just would like   hear the best reasons for why pow   pos     good idea    seems like almost entirely downside     personal opinion  under what circumstance   pos even remotely   secure   pow

ethereum,best explanation for what   gas,   gas   the name for   special unit used   ethereum   measures how much work   action   set   actions takes   perform for example   calculate one    cryptographic hash   will take   gas each time   hash   calculated  plus   cost     more gas for every 256 bits   data being hashed every operation that can   performed     transaction   contract   the ethereum platform costs   certain number   gas with operations that require more computational resources costing more gas than operations that require few computational resources the reason gas   important   that   helps   ensure   appropriate fee   being paid   transactions submitted   the network   requiring that   transaction pay for each operation   performs   causes   contract   perform   ensure that network doesn  become bogged down with performing   lot   intensive work that isn  valuable   anyone this     different strategy than the bitcoin transaction fee which   based only   the size   kilobytes     transaction since ethereum allows arbitrarily complex  computer code     run   short length   code can actually result     lot   computational work being done      important   measure the work done directly instead   just choosing   fee based   the length     transaction   contract     gas   basically   transaction fee how   you pay   this   where   gets   little tricky although gas     unit that things can   measured   there isn  any actual token for gas that   you can  own 1000 gas instead gas exists only inside   the ethereum virtual machine     count   how much work   being performed when   comes   actually paying for the gas the transaction fee   charged     certain number   ether the built  token   the ethereum network and the token with which miners are rewarded for producing blocks this might seem odd   first why don  operations just have   cost measured   ether directly the answer   that ether like bitcoins have   market price that can change rapidly but the cost   computation doesn        down just because the price   ether changes      helpful   separate out the price   computation from the price   the ether token   that the cost     operation doesn  have     changed every time the market moves the terminology here gets   little messy operations   the evm have gas cost but gas itself also has   gas price measured   terms   ether every transaction specifies the gas price     willing   pay   ether for each unit   gas allowing the market   decide the relationship between the price   ether and the cost   computing operations   measured   gas    the combination   the two total gas used multiplied   gas price paid that results   the total fee paid     transaction   tricky          important   understand this distinction because   results   one   the most confusing things about ethereum transactions   the initial learner there     difference between your transaction running out   gas and your transaction not having   high enough fee   the gas price   set     transaction   too low   one will even bother   run   transaction   the first place   will simply not   included   the blockchain   miners but     provide   acceptable gas price and then   transaction results     much computational work that the combined gas costs   past the amount   attached     fee that gas counts   spent and   don  get   back the miner will stop processing the transaction revert any changes   made but still include     the blockchain     failed transaction collecting the fees for   this may seem harsh but when you realise that the real work for the miner was   performing the computation you can see that they will never get those resources back either      only fair that you pay them for the work they did even though your badly designed transaction ran out   gas providing too big     fee   also different than providing too much ether   you set   very high gas price you will end   paying lots   ether for only   few operations just like setting   super high transaction fee   bitcoin you  definitely   prioritised   the front   the line but your money   gone   you provided   normal gas price however and just attached more ether than was needed   pay for the gas that your transaction consumed the excess amount will   refunded back   you miners only charge you for the work that they actually   you can think   the gas price   the hourly wage for the miner and the gas cost   their timesheet   work performed there are   lot   other subtleties   gas but that should give you the basics gas   the key mechanism that makes the complex computations   ethereum safe for the network   work   because any programs that run out   control will only last   long   the money provided   the people who requested they   run when the money stops the miners stop working     and the mistakes you make   your program will only affect the people who pay   use  the rest   the network can  suffer performance issues due   your error they will simply get   big payday when the performance issues consume all   your ether without this critical technique the idea     generalpurpose blockchain would have been completely impossible     gas   the way that fees are calculated  the fees are still paid   ether though which   different from gas  the gas cost   the amount   work that goes into something like the number   hours   labour whereas the gas price   like the hourly wage you pay for the work     done the combination   the two determines your total transaction fee    your gas price   too low   one will process your transaction    your gas price   fine but the gas cost   your transaction runs over budget the transaction fails but still goes into the blockchain and you don  get the money back for the work that the labourers did  this makes sure that nothing runs forever and that people will   careful about the code that they run   keeps both miners and users safe from bad code     source  
ethereum,how can   exchange erc20 coins into xrp,  currently have some erc20 rune and ethereum which exchange can   use   get xrp       the united states   the moment     cant use binance     add the xrp contract   metamask will this allow   for cross chain exchanges   just   store

ethereum,mev after the switch   pos,  just watched the new bankless episode   mev        highly recommend   subscribe   their channel   really helps   actually understand the ethereum ecosystem and stay   date   all the new developments   the video the bankless guys interview   panel   three mev researchers about mev and the implications     for decentralized trustless systems such   ethereum  mev   maximum extractable value   basically all the extra value that   block proposer either   miner under pow     validator under pos can extract from the system block proposers have this power because they can influence what transactions are included   the block and   what order they are included for instance they can sandwich frontrun trades they can trigger liquidations and buy   discounted coins and they can use many other strategies   extract basically steal extra value from the network and    users    think the main takeaway   that there does not seem       silver bullet   solving mev     appears that mev   inherent   trustless decentralized systems you cant just make   illegal like   traditional finance the best thing you can     try   guide       way that   nondetrimental   the network and make     transparent and accessible   possible   everyone   aware     and minersvalidators equally share   the profits       avoid centralization due   information asymmetry basically this   the goal   these researchers with the flashbots project  they also briefly discussed the effects   pos   mev and how the current pos model might actually worsen the mev problem  currently under pow block proposers are random based   the amount   hashpower they have     mining pool with   high percentage   the hashpower knows that   has   equally high chance   being the next block proposer however    still random   they can never   sure therefore its very difficult   perform multiblock mev strategies under pos block proposers are preselected and known   each   minute interval this means that block proposers that are adjacent   each other can not only extract mev from their own block but can also collude   perform multiblock mev strategies this has two very serious implications   multiblock mev strategies increase the value that can extracted stolen from the network and    users   and even worse     very centralizing basically   higher percentage   validators under your control   greater chance   controlling two   more blockproposers that are adjacent   each other   more mev that can   extracted   this means that centralized staking pools will not only   able   give more consistent payouts     solo staker the chance   proposing   block   quite small but also higher payouts   they generate more mev   people will   incentivized   quit solo staking and instead join   centralized service   pool single block mev seems bad enough but multiblock mev could perhaps really harm some protocols how bad would this actually   maybe there are mechanisms that would prevent   also would this centralizing effect actually play out   reality   are other existingplanned mechanisms that would counter this are there other ways   counter this    just seems like   very important topic that deserves more attention from the community looking forward   your insights

ethereum,how does pos   proposed   eth2 promote decentralization,first off   want     clear this isn    attack   eth2  how can you say higher transaction volume speed and efficiency   bad for ethereum  you can    course    been trying   educate myself   eth2 and   keep running into the same unanswered questions the chief   which   articulated   the title   this post     read through the eth2 explainer   the website and    read some   vitalik  explanations  the problem    running into   that these explanations make the assertion that staking will promote decentralization without robust evidence for why this would      yes the goal   ethereum        increase its scalability security and efficiency without sacrificing decentralization but how     going   accomplish that   know      nuanced question are   talking about decentralization relative     asic dominated pow system   relative     gpu dominated system   and the crux   the argument for pos promoting decentralization seems     that    supposed   have   lower barrier   entry   pow while having   high penalty for cheating     not sold   the former   profitable gpu mining rig   feasible   small scale and asics aren  that much worse the latter     reasonable argument though   would point out that destroying the actual equipment   not necessary   penalize bad actors even   burning their staked ether makes   significantly easier         pos when   think about getting into staking ether under ethereum      can  help but feel some concerns about       individual    you have hundreds   ether staking       pretty low bar sure  but even today   eth   over  000  that  not going   encourage   lot   individuals   become full validators   and   you  thinking about joining   staking pool because you have less than   eth     understand   that requires you   trust your eth   the pool which means you  also trusting the pool not   break the rules and get your ether burned through   fault   your own aside from the fault   choosing the wrong pool  defi100     very recent reminder   the risks   trusting   trustless systems    there are protections against this   would   relieved   hear about them     seems the barrier   pretty high   front for   individual looking   stake   the full   eth while joining   staking pool   stake   lower amount for the individual may put   high percentage   your investment   risk    decentralization requires many small participants   current hopefully incomplete understanding   staking makes   worry that   won  serve that purpose another concern   accumulation and consolidation   stakes  the incentive for stakeholders   both accumulate stockpiles   ether and stake high percentages   their holdings will probably   pretty good for the price   eth but the higher the price   eth goes the higher the barrier for entry  doesn  this run the risk   promoting consolidation among stakeholders   appreciate any clarifications   corrections  all can offer  thanks

ethereum,  crypto noob  journey since january 2021,  guys   will start this post with some context about myself         year old guy from india who just completed his bachelors   computer science and engineering   interned     full stack developer for   few months   2020 and managed   save about 800 usdt due   working from home although   got placed   this company through   university   wasn’  exactly   great workplace when they decided   delay converting the interns   full time employees   took the risk and resigned considering that   could   better and that   parents were financially secure enough and supportive for this for the next few months   did some interview preparation and courses but job hunting wasn’  easy especially   these difficult times   was also very frustrating   see all   friends earning and enjoying whereas   wasn  able     either starting this year   decided   invest into some place that could generate   some passive revenue only for   mental peace and this   when   came across cryptocurrency now thanks     education   did know   bit about blockchain but nothing about how   invest and the market     read   bit about   and decided   invest into bitcoin considering   was   good long term hold given the crazy volatility   this market and   dedicate some portion     day   learning about how   navigate this space   learnt that   were     bull run and the returns from here onward would   great and the fact that there were different crypto currencies with reasonable ideas and use cases that could   bought   investments   learnt that historically ethereum had been outperforming bitcoin and would     good hold   the bull run   which point   flipped all   btc for    eth   1250 usdt   then learnt about hedging your bets and decided   look into other coins that could prove     good eth competitors cardano was pretty low   that point        usdt with   decent market cap   planned roadmap and pos mode   governance     bought 540 cardano with the remaining money across the next few months   saw many peaks and dips and the net movement being     positive direction where all   can say     was   game   patience and discipline   this time   learnt about dollar cost averaging but since   had   more money   invest with   could not     people also said that one must take profits along the way and keep some amount   liquidity   buy   case there     big dip this seemed pretty reasonable but   was too greedy   take profits and decided   remain all   although this did work out     favor   would not recommend this   anyone dca and timely profit taking   the way       also learnt more about the crypto space during this time such   what were wallets like metamask yoroi daedalus etc decided   transfer   ada     wallet and stake   there were also pretty convincing reasons for why one should keep the bulk   the portfolio     wallet   you plan   hold   through this   managed   earn   ada after costs   transfer and staking fee   even learnt   bit about yield farming through liquidity pools things like impermanent loss etc   have decided   make   usdceth liquidity pool     enter   bear market for   decent apy and low impermanent loss   have picked quickswap     platform     this considering their high apy and quick tokens being severely undervalued compared   the sheer volume   transactions they are handling   also forgot   mention   also learnt about faucets and bridges   this process   consider myself mostly lucky here but   managed   timely liquidate   eth   3600 usdt cardano      usdt why these limits these are levels where the coins ended   consolidating duringafter the big dip from 4200 eth   was already three times above where   had started and decided   not   greedy   better approach   mentioned previously would     dca and keep taking   portion   profits   certain levels   lot     friends even complained about why   liquidated   eth and   this point   feel  ’    sort   cultish reason   hold these coins through the losses   hopes   going   maybe   shouldn’  have done   but   was already pretty obscene   have more than   times the money now that   had some stable coins   decided   invest again     dipped further and boy   did   bought    eth   2100 usdt and just yesterday    eth   1766 usdt this enabled        eth for the first time not all       good though when   started out   made and lost some ethereum flipping   for profits   daily trading   can bring   lot   stress   one’  life and not   mention       pretty addictive and slippery slope   have seen   friends become addicted     and have sustained significant losses even recently   bought some chainlink tokens thinking     pretty low only later   learn that alt coins will not perform   well   bitcoin   this stage   the market and   the off chance     lower they will fall significantly   current goals are   buy more and more bitcoin   this phase   the market now that   have    eth given the news     treasury inflation and the stock market   want   hold more btc even     falls lower   far   have bought  0105 btc through dca and have  250 usdt liquid   buy the dips which   dad gave     when   told him all this    have also lent the eth and btc   have for some marginal interest         exchange compounding   after every   days   portfolio today   3100 usdt and   feel crypto   the best investment   one considers the risks involved and exercises patience and discipline   their investment methods   have also considered selling   again     come close   3000 levels   eth and 42000   btc     could all   downhill from there again     personal note   have also finally managed   land   job     full stack developer     decent company after being rejected   over   shittier companies with   vastly better salary than before and   start working next month from   wealth management point   view now that   will   having   steady income   plan   diversify   investments across crypto well performing socks sips precious metals provident funds and fixed deposits   well   tax saving schemes such   life insurance and   bit   fiat because   feel that   early start   having   diverse portfolio would help     long way   life just thought that   would share   learnings being   the crypto space for the last five months and   everyone out there who   going through   much more difficult phase than     life view       opportunity learn new things discipline yourself and     pretty sure you can   far more than this crypto noob although people advise against revealing your crypto holdings here     picture     portfolio       still relatively small   have   other means   prove the story mentioned above   authentic      edit this got removed from  cryptocurrency because   don  have enough karma   post

was the craze   cryptokitties back   2017   the first nft wave hit the blockchain world the game was   popular   crashed ethereum   the time — well not crashed but increased fees   much   became too expensive   use ethereum fun fact — that wave wasn’  even     what  ’  experiencing right now   ethereum with defi and yet   one seems   mind because there’    much more   can     the blockchain than   could back then can you share   story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting can you tell   what lesson you learned from that   learned not   day trade against the house   losing   whole bitcoin   bitmex    have   idea when exactly that was   think around 2017   learned about this concept   betting   bitcoin price   betting with bitcoin   decided   try   out and   course   used 100x leverage right off the bat   few bad calls later   learned   lesson —   until then   had never traded only invested   icos and developed   this first trading experience made   learn what’  going   here actually and since then   grew     trader   well   think  ’    type   expensive mistake everyone has   make before succeeding   this space there’  just   other way   learn — other people’  mistakes simply   not teach not sure why that   but once you burn yourself you kind   “level  ” none     are able   achieve success without some help along the way   there   particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you   where you are can you share   story about that sure ophelie lechat from sitepointcom  was   boss when   was editor   the php tutorial channel there  ’  learned   ton from her and this prepared   for   very fruitful writing and editing career   education — this was the base   which all   work since then rests this was   job   had for some   years before blockchain and   was   charge   100 authors producing communitysourced tutorial content   this extremely popular technical education website   took   lot   effort   wrangle all those people verify their code and fix their writing and through guidance from ophelie   believe   matured from “just   guy   bit higher   the ladder”   “competent lead”   the very least with her help   also introduced some new concepts like peer review into technical writing   community sourced material something  ’  since taken into two other jobs   form two similar community     similarly successful way are you working   any exciting new projects now how   you think that will help people   have just launched   nft minting and trading     the kusama blockchain  ’  called singular can   found   singularrmrkapp  and   lets anyone mint clean eco nfts for   little     cents and sell them   others this   part     big nft drive   the kusama network and   huge ecosystem expansion plan — our focus     optimization     want   make   all easy   use   possible additionally the standard will spread out between all the chains that connect   kusama kusama   the chain that’  focused   connecting different blockchains together — like connecting bitcoin   ethereum and   monero   many ways  ’    tide that rises all boats — and our nft standards are standards that will     all those connected chains just through that connection  ’  all very exciting   super thank you for all that let’  now shift   the main focus   our interview  ’  sure you get this question all the time but for the benefit   our readers can you explain   your own words what   nft   and why people are spending   much money   them   nft   anything that can   presented     way that   unique   the observer     concert ticket even   one   many   special   the concert goer because  ’  theirs same with art and similar   layman’  terms   nft   quite simply just   database records   you having something that   not interchangeable with other somethings   the same type  ’  important   note that fungibility interchangeability     spectrum something that’  fungible   you may not   fungible     for example   cat and your cat are non fungible —   don’  consider them identical but two samelooking purple swords     video game might   fungible     and non fungible   you — you may value looks   which case   doesn’  matter which one you have but   may value the sword’  attributes and   that case they are absolutely non fungible     the nft industry seems   exciting right now what are the   things   particular that most excite you about the industry   you can please share   story   example for each composeable nfts are very exciting     — nfts owning nfts   alter visual and functional experiences nfts   daos also make sense — people democratically governing nft functionality and   course multiresource nfts   nfts can   multiple things   once   call these art legos and   built them   part   rmrk2    this enables   very exciting use case imagine   big digital billboard   some metaverse   space and then this billboard can have its shareholders dao and big brands like coca cola and pepsi can send   the   they want   display   the billboard   now the tokenholders   this nft can decide which     show and the corporations have   pay the tokenholders   vote   certain way the billboard     nft the land     placed       nft and the texture   the     display     nft you suddenly have communitygoverned metaverse real estate what are the   things that concern you about the industry can you explain what can   done   address those concerns lots   people are minting just for the sake   minting and making money and  ’  all kind   losing its appeal due   lack   quality  ’  also worried about the fees — people are paying too much unnecesarily when they could   using almost free minting   something like the kusama blockchain lastly   don’  think the approach taken   many nft platforms   longterm healthy — too many rely   centralized servers   host the nft assets and     those companies   bust the nfts   too missing the point   blockchain   instead nft assets should   hosted   something like ipfs   they can   fetched   any client   any time even   the project stops existing you wouldn’  like your mona lisa   render   “404 image not found”   years after you buy   right what are the “myths” that you would like   dispel about nfts can you explain what you mean there’    myth that   nft   forever because  ’  “  the blockchain” but because many projects and companies rely   third party centralized hosting solutions   keep those assets around   those central points   failures fail then the nfts disappear owners   the nfts are left with   empty husk   what they once purchased people should instead always check how   nft   built and how much     longevity potential   has another myth   that nfts are bad for the environment that’    very silly gotcha attempted   the antinft crowd but   fact those blocks would   mined regardless and there’  plenty   proof stake alternatives which don’  mine   all and thus don’  pollute   all — our platform singularrmrkapp    built   one such chain   minting   thousand nfts costs about   much energy     would take nature   dissolve   breadcrumb what are the most common mistakes you have seen people make when they enter the nft industry what can   done   avoid that minting   ethereum while gas prices are high and paying thousands   dollars   fees  they should wait for low gas prices hard       just move     cheaper platform the other mistake   not estimating their value properly — too many people undersell themselves while others oversell themselves — both base their prices   outliers when they should   following averages and the wisdom   the crowd   particular crypto twitter     good measure   current popularity how   you think nfts have the potential   help society   the future nfts   irrevocable

ethereum,how does pos not artificially inflate price,before you aim your downvote cannons     know that    long   eth and ada   can  help but feel that pos helps drive price artificially while not offering any benefit beyond pow besides the environmental concerns   mining    looking   have   opinion changed not   shit   pos   order   secure the network you must buy and not sell   fact there   great incentive   keep buying and never sell because the more you stake the more you make the more buying that occurs without equivalent selling the more the price goes   eventually you could get     point where liquidity dries   and the price   sky high because everyone has their coins staked once big exchanges like coinbase allow the average user   stake the amount staked will skyrocket and   can  see how that doesn  drive the price way   the price should     because the coins become more desirable for reasons other than the potential acquiring more coins and ultimately more money   your pocket the utility should   driving demand and ultimately price with pow the miners just mine whatever   the most profitable they don  help generate demand for the coins when demand for the coins     miners point more   their resources   those coins this independence feels better     because   everyone decides that pow coins are worthless one day then the sell side goes way   which drives the price down and miners   out   business change   mind
